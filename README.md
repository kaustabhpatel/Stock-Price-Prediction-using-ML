# Stocks-Prediction using Machine Learning

Stocks data is a time series data and hence we'll use various state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict stocks price.

Models that we will use are:
1. Arima
2. LSTM

Follow the Jupyter notebook uploaded in the stocks.ipynb for the complete analysis
